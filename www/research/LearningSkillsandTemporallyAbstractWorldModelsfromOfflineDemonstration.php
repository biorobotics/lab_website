This project seeks to automatically learn skill sets and temporally-abstract, skill-conditioned world dynamics models purely from offline data, enabling sequences of skills to be rapidly planned to solve new tasks. &nbsp;Initial experiments show that our skill-planning approach performs comparably to or better than a wide array of state-of-the-art offline RL algorithms on a number of simulated robotics locomotion and manipulation benchmarks, while offering a higher degree of robustness and adaptability to new goals. </span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 178.67px;"><img alt="" src="images/LearningSkillsandTemporallyAbstractWorldModelsfromOfflineDemonstration/image31.png" style="width: 624.00px; height: 178.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c18"><span class="c5">Recently machine learning techniques, specifically Reinforcement Learning (RL), are being used rigorously to enable robots to perform in a desired manner. Two major challenges continue to prevent the widespread deployment of RL solutions. First, no safety guarantees are provided and so these techniques are not used in safety critical systems. Secondly, most of the successes shown by these learning techniques are only in simulation and the behavior upon transfer to real world settings is quite poor. The aim of this project is to borrow techniques from control theory to provide safety guarantees, smooth sim-to-real transfer, accelerated learning, and robustness. Currently, we build upon the work done in Dream to Control which is a model based reinforcement learning SOTA algorithm and uses only images, rewards and actions as inputs and learns a model in a small latent space as well as actions. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5"></span></p></body></html><!-- <div class="six columns">
			<h3><b>Modularity</b> - Modular manipulators</h3>
			<p>
				<b>Modular robotic systems</b> have the potential to be adapted to varying tasks using a single set of reconfigurable hardware, enabling customizable robots to be developed faster and more economically than conventional robots. Currently, even with the engineering experience, calculations and intuitions, it is not immediately evident how to construct and program a modular robot for a task. We research methods to automatically synthesize the design and controllers for modular robot arms.
