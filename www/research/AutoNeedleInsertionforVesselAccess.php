One challenge in this problem is how to model the needle dynamics and kinematics as it shifts through different scenarios: outside the skin, in contact with the skin surface and inside the skin surface. The needle will behave differently in different scenarios. Furthermore, other challenges are the constant movement of the skin surface of insertion due to heavy breathing of the patient, needle passing through the vessel due to excess force applied, needle slipping off the vessel due to which the vessel can form a haematoma. Moreover, the exact location of the needle tip is also not accurate. To counter these problems, we are designing a control law which takes force measurement at the needle tip as feedback and will be modeling the needle dynamics based on different scenarios. Furthermore, we&rsquo;ll also model the approximate behavior of the needle when it contacts a vessel and how we can exploit the geometry of the vessel to ensure guarantee in needle insertion. Finally, we are developing a roboto module that uses optical sensors and pressure sensors to detect and confirm successful insertion into the vessel. </span></p><p class="c18"><span class="c50 c38 c13">Relevant Publications:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c60 c38 c36"></span></p><p class="c18"><span class="c16 c11 c36">Zevallos, Nico, et al. &quot;Toward robotically automated femoral vascular access.&quot; 2021 International Symposium on Medical Robotics (ISMR).

			<h3><b>Modularity</b> - Modular manipulators</h3>
			<p>
				<b>Modular robotic systems</b> have the potential to be adapted to varying tasks using a single set of reconfigurable hardware, enabling customizable robots to be developed faster and more economically than conventional robots. Currently, even with the engineering experience, calculations and intuitions, it is not immediately evident how to construct and program a modular robot for a task. We research methods to automatically synthesize the design and controllers for modular robot arms.
