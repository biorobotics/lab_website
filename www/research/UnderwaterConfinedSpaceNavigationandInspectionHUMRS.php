The purpose of this project is to expand the range of operating environments in which robots can perform inspection and maintenance. In particular, our research, and the snake-like robots we have designed to support it, focuses on navigating through submerged structures and containers such as ballast tanks, fuel tanks, and pipelines. To achieve this, we first built a waterproof modular snake-like robot (</span><span class="c38 c13">H</span><span class="c13">ardened </span><span class="c38 c13">U</span><span class="c13">nderwater </span><span class="c38 c13">M</span><span class="c13">odular </span><span class="c38 c13">R</span><span class="c13">obotic </span><span class="c38 c13">S</span><span class="c5">nake) that is both agile and robust. We also designed a user-friendly tele-op control system to perform human-in-loop inspections. The challenge primarily lies with the turbulence and turbid environment, making it difficult for human operators to identify the robot&rsquo;s current state. Current work seeks to mitigate this via increased autonomy. Development of a robust real-time path planning capability via search and online, contact aware, Model Predictive Control is anticipated to reduce operator burden and expand the environments HUMRS can access.</span></p><p class="c17"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 240.00px; height: 240.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/UnderwaterConfinedSpaceNavigationandInspectionHUMRS/image93.png" style="width: 240.00px; height: 240.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c17 c51"><span class="c5"></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c29"><a class="c24" href="#h.jpmbcvqkcs3b">[Home]</a></span></p><!-- <div class="six columns">
			<h3><b>Modularity</b> - Modular manipulators</h3>
			<p>
				<b>Modular robotic systems</b> have the potential to be adapted to varying tasks using a single set of reconfigurable hardware, enabling customizable robots to be developed faster and more economically than conventional robots. Currently, even with the engineering experience, calculations and intuitions, it is not immediately evident how to construct and program a modular robot for a task. We research methods to automatically synthesize the design and controllers for modular robot arms.
