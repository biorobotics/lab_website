Transferring a critically ill patient to a hospital with sufficient staff additionally results in a worse patient outcome.</span></p><p class="c52"><span class="c3 c1">As a joint effort sourcing experts in pulmonary care, biomedical engineering, and robotics from CMU and Pitt, our team has developed a prototype to address these challenges. Robovent is a low-cost ventilation system with telemedicine support initially created in response to healthcare strains highlighted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Expanding on this work through active research in ventilation control systems, tele-critical data collection, machine learning, and other respiratory support hardware, we intend to improve the overall efficacy of respiratory care through the creation of modular medical technologies.</span></p><!-- <div class="six columns">
			<h3><b>Modularity</b> - Modular manipulators</h3>
			<p>
				<b>Modular robotic systems</b> have the potential to be adapted to varying tasks using a single set of reconfigurable hardware, enabling customizable robots to be developed faster and more economically than conventional robots. Currently, even with the engineering experience, calculations and intuitions, it is not immediately evident how to construct and program a modular robot for a task. We research methods to automatically synthesize the design and controllers for modular robot arms.
